1. Secure TLS/SSL for Financial Transactions

   Goal: Replace classical key exchange mechanisms (e.g., RSA, ECDH) in TLS/SSL with Kyber for quantum-safe encryption.

   Implementation:

        Use Kyber in a hybrid mode (e.g., Kyber + ECDH) during the transition period to ensure backward compatibility.

        Prioritize securing high-risk transactions (e.g., wire transfers, login authentication).

        Update TLS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BoringSSL) to support Kyber-based key encapsulation.

2. Database Protection

   Goal: Safeguard sensitive financial data (e.g., customer PII, transaction records) with quantum-resistant encryption.

   Implementation:

        Use Kyber to encrypt symmetric keys (e.g., AES-256 keys) that encrypt databases at rest.

        Integrate Kyber with existing key management systems (e.g., HSMs) for secure key generation/storage.

        Apply to high-value datasets, such as credit card details or account balances.

3. Internal Communications and APIs

   Goal: Protect interservice communication (e.g., microservices, cloud APIs).

   Implementation:

        Enforce Kyber for mTLS (mutual TLS) in internal networks.

        Secure API gateways with quantum-safe key exchange.

4. Digital Signatures (Clarification)

   Kyber is not a signature algorithm. For document signing, pair Kyber with a post-quantum signature scheme (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, or SPHINCS+).

   Implementation:

        Use Dilithium for general-purpose document signing (NIST’s primary recommendation).

        Use Falcon for signatures with smaller footprints (e.g., blockchain transactions).

5. Hybrid Transition Strategy

   Goal: Maintain compatibility with legacy systems during the PQC migration.

   Implementation:

        Deploy hybrid cryptography (e.g., Kyber + ECDH for TLS, Dilithium + ECDSA for signatures).

        Phase out classical algorithms gradually after testing and regulatory approval.

6. Compliance and Risk Mitigation

   Regulatory Alignment: Ensure Kyber meets financial standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) once NIST finalizes the standard.

   Performance Testing: Benchmark Kyber’s impact on latency (e.g., trade settlements, real-time payments).

   Education: Train teams on PQC integration and key lifecycle management.
